mapsengine-api-tutorial
=======================

A tutorial which covers the basics of using the Google Maps Engine API.

API reference documentation:
http://developers.google.com/maps-engine

**Note:** The Google Maps Engine API is deprecated. Support for the 
Google Maps Engine (GME) product ends on January 29th, 2016. 
You can use your existing GME project as well as the GME API 
until that date. After January 29th, 2016, GME will be deactivated 
and the API will therefore no longer be available.
